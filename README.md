Resize a movie for your Android/iOS device with ffmpeg.

Get a static FFmpeg build from <http://ffmpeg.gusari.org/static/>.

This mini project was inspired by the LUD-Media-Converter
(<https://github.com/kunaldeo/LUD-Media-Converter>).

Usage:
------

    ./movie2android.py movie.avi

It will resize the movie and produce a `movie.mp4` file.
If the input was called `movie.mp4`, the output will be
called `movie-resized.mp4`. You can change the ffmpeg settings
by adjusting the `config` dictionary in the source.

You can also pass *several* parameters to the script and they
will be processed one by one in a queue.
